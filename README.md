# world5gui
is a python application which is based on tkinter (it's one of pythons gui libaries which should be already installed or you could need a new installation but it should work python3 or higher)

window2.py needs pyqt instead of window.py , insert in your cmd(if you have python3 on your device,else install it and then) "pip install pyqt5", but do only insert that text, no special chiffre/ keys
